## password-generator

Created a java script file that would take a serious of questions to generate a password based on the user criteria.

Would they like?
- Uppercase
- lowercase
- Number characters
- special characters

It was coded so that they must pick a number between 8 and 128 and also that they must atleast pick one of or both uppercase or lower case other wise it would loop until they picked the correct choice.

example below:
